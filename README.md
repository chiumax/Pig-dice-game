Hi, thanks for checking out my repository!

This is a dice game called Pig and can be played with two people. The rules can be found below.

Check it out live: https://dumblole.github.io/Pig-dice-game/

I made this using javascript and the rules are based off of [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game)).

Since it's my very first javascript project, if there are any changes to improve this project, I'd greatly appreciate it.


## How to Play :notebook_with_decorative_cover:

The game is created based off of these rules:

- There are two players in the game

- Default winning score is 100, but you can change it to any number

- You may roll as much as you can, but:

    - If you roll a one, you lose your 'current' score and it is the next player's turn
    
    - If you roll two sixes, you lose all of your score and it is the next player's turn
    
- The first person to hold with a total score that is the same or higher than the winning score, said person wins.
